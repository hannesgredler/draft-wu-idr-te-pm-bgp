    <abstract>
      <t>In order to populate network performance information like link
      latency, latency variation, packet loss and bandwidth into Traffic
      Engineering Database(TED) and ALTO server, this document describes
      extensions to BGP protocol, that can be used to distribute network
      performance information (such as link delay, delay variation, packet
      loss, residual bandwidth, available bandwidth, and utilized 
      bandwidth).</t>

    <section anchor="intro" title="Introduction">
      <t>As specified in [RFC4655],a Path Computation Element (PCE) is an
      entity that is capable of computing a network path or route based on a
      network graph, and of applying computational constraints during the
      computation. In order to compute an end to end path, the PCE needs to
      have a unified view of the overall topology[I-D.ietf-pce-pcep-
      service-aware]. [I.D-ietf-idr-ls-distribution] describes a mechanism by
      which links state and traffic engineering information can be collected
      from networks and shared with external components using the BGP routing
      protocol. This mechanism can be used by both PCE and ALTO server to
      gather information about the topologies and capabilities of the
      network.</t>

      <t>With the growth of network virtualization technology, the needs for
      inter-connection between various overlay technologies (e.g. Enterprise
      BGP/MPLS IP VPNs) in the Wide Area Network (WAN) become important. The
      Network performance or QoS requirements such as latency, limited
      bandwidth, packet loss, and jitter, are all critical factors that must
      be taken into account in the end to end path computation
      ([I-D.ietf-pce-pcep-service-aware])and selection which enable
      establishing segment overlay tunnel between overlay nodes and stitching
      them together to compute end to end path.</t>

      <t>In order to populate network performance information like link
      latency, latency variation, packet loss and bandwidth into TED and ALTO
      server, this document describes extensions to BGP protocol, that can be
      used to distribute network performance information (such as link delay,
      delay variation, packet loss, residual bandwidth, available
      bandwidth, and utilized bandwidth).</t>

      <section title="MPLS-TE with PCE">
        <t>In inter-AS path computation, PCE in each AS participant in
        different IGP. In Hierarchy of PCE, A child PCE must be configured
        with the address of its parent PCE[RFC6805].Configuration system is
        challenged by handling changes in parent PCE identities and coping
        with failure events, especially when parent PCE and child PCE are not
        a part of the same routing domain.</t>

        <t>The following figure shows how a PCE can get its TE performance
        information beyond that contained in the LINK_STATE attributes

    <section title="Carrying TE Performance information in BGP">
      <t>This document proposes new BGP TE performance TLVs that can be
      announced as attribute in the BGP-LS attribute (defined in
      [I.D-ietf-idr- ls-distribution]) to distribute network performance
      information. The extensions in this document build on the ones provided
      in BGP-LS [I.D-ietf-idr-ls-distribution] and BGP-4 [RFC4271].</t>

      <t>BGP-LS attribute defined in [I.D-ietf-idr-ls-distribution] has nested
      TLVs which allow the BGP-LS attribute to be readily extended. This
      document proposes seven additional TLVs as its attributes:<figure>
          <artwork>
   Type            Value

   TBD1        Unidirectional Link Delay

   TBD2        Min/Max Unidirectional Link Delay

   TBD3        Unidirectional Delay Variation

   TBD4        Unidirectional Packet Loss

   TBD5        Unidirectional Residual Bandwidth

   TBD6        Unidirectional Available Bandwidth
   
   TBD7        Unidirectional Utilized Bandwidth
</artwork>
        </figure><vspace blankLines="1" /><!--< - - !
When this draft(v-01) was presented in the IDR WG session of Berlin meeting,John Scudder 
suggested to define new attributes(i.e.,link utilization attribute, channel throughput 
attribute) added in the previous version of this draft in the 
draft-ietf-isis-te-metric-extensions. After Berlin meeting, Hannes Gredler help initiate 
discussion with authors of IGP drafts(i.e., draft-ietf-isis-te-metric-extensions and 
draft-ietf-ospf-te-metric-extensions) on why two additional attributes should be added 
into IGPdraft. After a few offline discussion with authors of IGP drafts, specially 
with John Drake, David Ward, Alia Atlas,Stefano Previdi,it was roughly agreed that 

a.drop channel throughput attribute since it is node attribute rather than link attribute.
b.and add link utilization attribute into IGP drafts.

However the open issue is whether defining total Link Utilization as Currently Utilized 
Bandwidth or as Currently Utilized Bandwidth / Maximum Bandwidth. Until this openissue 
is resolved, the link utilization attribute will the added into the update of this draft 
as seventh additional TLV.

- - >--></t>

      <t>As can be seen in the list above, the TLVs described in this document
      carry different types of network performance information. These TLVs
      include a bit called the Anomalous (or "A") bit at the left-most bit
      after length field of each TLV. The other bits in the first octets after
      length field of each TLV is reserved for future use. When the A bit is
      clear (or when the TLV does not include an A bit), the TLV describes
      steady state link performance. This information could conceivably be
      used to construct a steady state performance topology for initial tunnel
      path computation, or to verify alternative failover paths.</t>

      <t>When network performance downgrades and exceeds configurable maximum
      thresholds, a TLV with the A bit set is advertised. These TLVs could be
      used by the receiving BGP peer to determine whether to redirect failing
      traffic to a backup path, or whether to calculate an entirely new path.
      If link performance improves later and falls below a configurable value,
      that TLV can be re- advertised with the Anomalous bit cleared. In this
      case, a receiving BGP peer can conceivably do whatever re-optimization
      (or failback) it wishes to do (including nothing).</t>

      <t>Note that when a TLV does not include the A bit, that TLV cannot be
      used for failover purposes. The A bit was intentionally omitted from
      some TLVs to help mitigate oscillations.</t>

      <t>Consistent with existing ISIS TE specifications [ISIS-TE-METRIC],
      the bandwidth advertisements,the delay and delay variation
      advertisements, packetloss defined in this document MUST be encoded in
      the same unit as one defined in IS-IS Extended IS Reachability sub-TLVs
      [ISIS-TE-METRIC]. All values (except residual bandwidth) MUST be
      calculated as rolling averages where the averaging period MUST be a
      configurable period of time.</t>
    </section>

    <section title="Attribute TLV Details">
      <t>Link attribute TLVs defined in section 3.2.2 of [I-D.ietf-idr-ls-
      distribution]are TLVs that may be encoded in the BGP-LS attribute with a
      link NLRI. Each 'Link Attribute' is a Type/Length/ Value (TLV) triplet
      formatted as defined in Section 3.1 of [I-D.ietf-id r- ls-distribution].
      The format and semantics of the 'value' fields in some 'Link Attribute'
      TLVs correspond to the format and semantics of value fields in IS-IS
      Extended IS Reachability sub-TLVs, defined in [RFC5305]. Although the
      encodings for 'Link Attribute' TLVs were originally defined for IS-IS,
      the TLVs can carry data sourced either by IS-IS or OSPF.</t>
